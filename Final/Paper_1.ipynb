into one hot code**\n","\n","A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors. This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values. Then, each integer value is represented as a binary vector that is all zero values except the index of the integer, which is marked with a 1 and as this is a multi classification problem so we can convert the output class values into one-hot format which is simply a binary matrix, i.e.\n","\n","value 0 will be converted to one-hot format as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","\n","value 1 will be converted to one-hot format as [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] etc"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"metadata":{"_uuid":"e49b0b3e5cd42ae31022de8dd1b8274901f08246","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["10"]},"execution_count":23,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# input encode\n","y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train)\n","num_classes = y_train.shape[1]\n","num_classes"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"_uuid":"bceaf8140ee1d06c839e01e1686ef316802da51c","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["1 (42000, 1, 28, 28) (28000, 1, 28, 28)\n"]}],"source":["# Melakukan shaping pada gambar untuk cnn 2 dimensi input\n","x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 1, 28, 28).astype('float32')\n","x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 1, 28, 28).astype('float32')\n","num_pixels = x_train.shape[1]\n","print (num_pixels, x_train.shape, x_test.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"metadata":{"_uuid":"410355674a6aaa607ed7474221b267a3d1693bae","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["nn = 10\n","model = [0]*nn\n","\n","for j in range(nn):\n","    model[j] = Sequential()\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), input_shape=(1, 28, 28), activation='relu',data_format='channels_first'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size = 5, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.4))\n","    \n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size = 5, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.4))\n","    \n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Conv2D(128, kernel_size = 4, activation='relu'))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Flatten())\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.4))\n","    model[j].add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n","    \n","    #
